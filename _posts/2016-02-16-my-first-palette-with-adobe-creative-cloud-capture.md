This image by [Kehinde Wiley][0] inspired the color palette used for The Elementary MBA logo. Below you'll see the first draft of the logo. I was introduced to Kehinde Wiley's work by a friend, [Andia Winslow][1], during a trip to the [Phoenix Museum of Contemporary Art][2]. A few years later another friend, Annabel Wong, mentioned him and his work to me. Both of these individuals had the opportunity to meet Kehinde during their travels on the East Coast.

It wasn't until last Wednesday that I decided how this piece would be used in my life. I love the colors used. It's a beautiful piece. My logo, not so much. I went to the museum that day to find a piece of art to generate the perfect color palette for the logo. Finding the right color is easy when I see it. Difficult when trying to create it on my own. I feel like a super hero with the Adobe Capture app. I look out into my community, my world, and I see beauty. Adobe Capture enables me to repurpose that beauty.

By the way, the Phx Museum of Contemporary Art is FREE on Wednesdays and it's a great place to go on dates, especially first dates.
