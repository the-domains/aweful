My First Palette With Adobe Creative Cloud Capture

This image by [Kehinde Wiley][0] inspired the color palette used for The Elementary MBA logo. Below you'll see the first draft of the logo. I was introduced to Kehinde Wiley's work by a friend, [Andia Winslow][1], during a trip to the [Phoenix Museum of Contemporary Art][2]. A few years later another friend, Annabel Wong, mentioned him and his work to me. Both of these individuals had the opportunity to meet Kehinde during their travels on the East Coast.

It wasn't until last Wednesday that I decided how this piece would be used in my life. I love the colors used. It's a beautiful piece. My logo, not so much.
