Autodidact Career Development

I began this journey a year ago after an impromptu ending to a good job with Infusionsoft. I was fired two weeks after receiving stock options and six weeks after receiving a trip to DisneyLand.

It's one word. I didn't know that before the trip.

The plans before my exodus were to make business automation a career.

Now I'm ready for a change. I've had many great ideas over the years. Some of them required the assistance of a skilled developer. I learned over time that convincing someone to invest their time in realizing my dream is a daunting task. It wasn't because I lacked sales skills. I can sale. I don't enjoy asking people to do things they don't want to do. I don't like selling things to people that they don't want nor need. That's one of the reasons I chose to teach myself to code.

Learning is one of the greatest feelings I've felt. Unlike other pleasureable experiences, It Lasts. It leads directly to more good times.

When applied, It Leads To Change.
